# Venue Management Dashboard (TypeScript)

**Tech:** React + TypeScript, mock Firebase (local). Designed to be GitHub-ready and easy to demo locally.

## What is included
- `src/` : React + TypeScript app using a `mock/firebase` module that simulates Firestore.
- Minimal Vite setup (package.json + tsconfig + vite.config.ts)

## Run locally
1. Install Node.js (16+ recommended).
2. In project root:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (Vite default) and you will see the dashboard.

## Why this matches Taiv
- Frontend built in React + TypeScript similar to Taiv's web apps.
- Real-time-like behavior and simple controls for venue screens.
- Easy to extend to real Firebase and Cloud Functions later.
